## Talk points - What do I mean

We usually work on some principles when developing:

*  Keep It Stupid Simple
*  Dry/Wet
*  Make it work, maybe refactor then don't touch!
*  Have not had to think about the costs of our software
*  Customers claims are uncertain: Our old systemis super fast!

**Advent of Code**

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

And that is true.

So knowing this means we can code against it.
Hmmm really slow, why?

Learn lots about the language you use or use it to learn a new one (harder).

Plus 2 extra bonus items:
*  Its fun
*  Stars lead to a peng for charity.
